Neuron tracing and digital reconstruction from original neurons image information is a hot direction of neural science. Neurons form reflects its function, the structure of the same neurons usually has a similar function.By the reconstruction of the structure of the brain atlas, neuroscientists can backstepping, how the brain works is important to understand the wisdom of help.Because of the complexity of the topological structure of neurons, and in some details on the results of automation reconstruction researchers still need to manually correct the results of digital reconstruction and modify, in order to ensure the accuracy of the digital reconstruction.In addition, researchers need to edit the result of the digital reconstruction such as add or delete some branch network, etc.Existing neurons tracking for original nerve image information and digital reconstruction software is mostly run on stand-alone, unable to meet the requirements of multi-user collaborative editing and modification, but also not conducive to the exchange of structural brain atlas.Computer performance and network speed increase online real-time editing neural network structure.In such a background, the design and implement the neural network structure of online multi-user edit sharing platform, using the Internet to facilitate data sharing and exchange, the characteristics of the neurological research personnel can conveniently for long distance, a multi-user collaborative editing neural network structure, and can share complete reconstruction of the structure of the brain atlas, explore the mysteries of neuron structure.Project USES DVID database information storage neurons, PostgreSQL to store user information and use Node. Js and Express completed the construction of the network server, provides the powerful support for the front-end visual operation.Experiment and test report shows that the platform can support at least thousands of users at the same time the editor's demand, and can in the millisecond level time given accordingly, has reached the requirement of real-time operation, tracking and digital reconstruction by neuroscientists at neurons provides convenient.
